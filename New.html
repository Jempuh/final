    <h1>An Interview With My Mother</h1>
    <h2>By Joshua Torres</h2>
    <p>I interviewed my mother about how life was back then, and how her coming here as an immigrant was tough. This was a hard interview to do because my mom is extremely scared to talk about this since she could get you know... We also disuss differeing politcal views on the American Dreams. The raw audio was about 20 minutes longs, but I cut it up for to keep it more lively,and also added much needed noise suppression. I cut out some other personal stuff because she had a traumatic experiecne coming here. The interview is organized from the introduction, difference from Mexico to the United States, The cultural shock from arriving at the United states,and lastly the American dream. </p>
